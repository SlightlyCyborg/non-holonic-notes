Summary of the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.htmlASDF][ASDF Manual]]

* Introduction

** 3 faces of ASDF
- users
- writers
- build-system-extenders
    
ASDF is not a tool library and system installation, only for building

** Quick start summary

*** Simple Loading (without Quicklisp)
- (require "asdf")
- put code in ~/common-lisp/ or configure ASDF to find my systems*
- (asdf:load-system "holon")

*** Make ASDF system
- make repository directory where ASDF can find it
- create <name>.asd
- (asdf:load-system "<name>")


** Loading ASDF
*** Preinstalled ASDF
 ASDF is included with all major CL impls, so...

- (require "asdf")

It may be a good idea to load asdf in the common lisp startup script

*** Check if ASDF is loaded
- (asdf:asdf-version)
  
*** Upgrading ASDF, Replacing Preinstalled ASDF, and Loading from Source
No need. I use SBCL
