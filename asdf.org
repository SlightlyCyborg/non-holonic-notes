Summary of the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.htmlASDF][ASDF Manual]]

* Introduction

** 3 faces of ASDF
- users
- writers
- build-system-extenders
    
ASDF is not a tool library and system installation, only for building

* Quick start summary

** Simple Loading (without Quicklisp)
- (require "asdf")
- put code in ~/common-lisp/ or configure ASDF to find my systems*
- (asdf:load-system "holon")

** Make ASDF system
- make repository directory where ASDF can find it
- create <name>.asd
- (asdf:load-system "<name>")


* Loading ASDF
** Preinstalled ASDF
 ASDF is included with all major CL impls, so...

- (require "asdf")

It may be a good idea to load asdf in the common lisp startup script

** Check if ASDF is loaded
- (asdf:asdf-version)
  
** Upgrading ASDF, Replacing Preinstalled ASDF, and Loading from Source
No need. I use SBCL


* Configuration
  Probably not imporant to me. Skipping for now
  
* Using ASDF
** Loading a system
- (asdf:load-system :foo)

On some implementations, ASDF hooks into cl:require, ergo
- (require :foo)

The system-name is provided as a string, symbol, or keyword.
Lower case names by convention

** Convenience Functions  
*** Common Fn's
- `load-system`
- `compile-system`
- `test-system`
*** UnCommons
- `require-system`: skips loading already loades systems.
- `make`: a customizable way to load
- `operate`: arbitrarily operate on systems
